Installing macOS on VirtualBox involves several steps. Below is a general guide to help you through the process. Please note that running macOS on non-Apple hardware may violate Apple's End User License Agreement (EULA), so proceed at your own risk.

### Prerequisites:
1. **VirtualBox**: Download and install the latest version of VirtualBox from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. **macOS Installer**: You will need a macOS installer (ISO or DMG file). This can be obtained from the Mac App Store if you have access to a Mac, or through other means (e.g., creating a bootable installer).
3. **VirtualBox Extension Pack**: Download and install the VirtualBox Extension Pack from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
4. **Enough System Resources**: Ensure your host machine has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space) to run a virtual machine.

### Step 1: Create a New Virtual Machine
1. Open VirtualBox and click on **New**.
2. Name your virtual machine (e.g., "macOS"), set the type to **Mac OS X**, and the version to **macOS 10.13 High Sierra (64-bit)** or later, depending on your installer.
3. Allocate at least **4GB of RAM** (more if possible) and create a virtual hard disk with at least **30GB of space**.

### Step 2: Configure the Virtual Machine
1. Select the newly created VM and click on **Settings**.
2. Go to **System** > **Processor** and allocate at least **2 CPUs**.
3. Go to **Display** > **Screen** and increase the **Video Memory** to at least **128MB**.
4. Go to **Storage**, select the empty optical drive, and click on the disk icon to choose the macOS installer ISO/DMG file.
5. Go to **USB**, enable **USB 2.0** or **USB 3.0** controller.

### Step 3: Modify VM Settings via Command Line
VirtualBox does not officially support macOS, so you need to tweak some settings using the command line.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the VirtualBox installation directory (e.g., `cd "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox"` on Windows).
3. Run the following commands (replace `YourVMName` with the name of your VM):

   ```bash
   VBoxManage modifyvm "YourVMName" --cpuidset 00000001 000106e5 00100800 0098e3fd bfebfbff
   VBoxManage setextradata "YourVMName" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiSystemProduct" "iMac11,3"
   VBoxManage setextradata "YourVMName" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiSystemVersion" "1.0"
   VBoxManage setextradata "YourVMName" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiBoardProduct" "Iloveapple"
   VBoxManage setextradata "YourVMName" "VBoxInternal/Devices/smc/0/Config/DeviceKey" "ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)AppleComputerInc"
   VBoxManage setextradata "YourVMName" "VBoxInternal/Devices/smc/0/Config/GetKeyFromRealSMC" 1
   ```

### Step 4: Install macOS
1. Start the virtual machine.
2. The macOS installer should boot. Follow the on-screen instructions to install macOS.
3. When prompted, select the virtual hard disk you created as the installation destination.
4. Complete the installation process, which may take some time.

### Step 5: Post-Installation
1. After installation, you may need to install VirtualBox Guest Additions for better performance and features (though macOS support is limited).
2. Adjust settings as needed (e.g., screen resolution, shared folders).

### Troubleshooting:
- **Stuck on Apple Logo**: Ensure you have allocated enough resources and followed all steps correctly.
- **Installation Fails**: Verify the integrity of your macOS installer and ensure your VM settings are correct.

### Important Notes:
- Running macOS on non-Apple hardware may violate Apple's EULA.
- Performance may not be optimal, as VirtualBox is not optimized for macOS.
